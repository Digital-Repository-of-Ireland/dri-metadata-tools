# dri-metadata-tools - Jupyter Notebooks
A selection of Jupyter Notebooks for preparing metadata.

Jupyter notebooks are documents that blend text, code and its output. They are often used to share a researcher's work in a transparent way, allowing all of the research processes and steps to be understood and reproduced.

The notebooks provided here allow users to manipulate metadata. They may ask you to upload some files or provide a link to metadata online. By running the code in these notebooks on your metadata, you can clean or transform it in some way which will help you to produce rich metadata for ingest into the Digital Repository of Ireland, or another platform that supports Dublin Core metadata.

To use these notebooks, it is not necessary to fully understand what the code is doing. You simply need to run the code blocks in the correct order, and provide the appropriate input when requested.

You can access each notebook and find detailed instructions on how to use them by clicking on the links below.
